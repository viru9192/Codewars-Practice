The populationregularly increases by <code>2 percent</code> per year and moreover <code>50</code> new inhabitants per year come to live in the town. How many years does the town need to see its populationgreater than or equal to <code>p = 1200</code> inhabitants?</p><pre><code>At the end of the first year there will be: 1000 + 1000 * 0.02 + 50 =&gt; 1070 inhabitantsAt the end of the 2nd year there will be: 1070 + 1070 * 0.02 + 50 =&gt; 1141 inhabitants (** number of inhabitants is an integer **)At the end of the 3rd year there will be:1141 + 1141 * 0.02 + 50 =&gt; 1213It will need 3 entire years.</code></pre><p>More generally given parameters:</p><p><code>p0, percent, aug (inhabitants coming or leaving each year), p (population to equal or surpass)</code></p><p>the function <code>nb_year</code> should return <code>n</code> number of entire years needed to get a population greater or equal to <code>p</code>.</p><p>aug is an integer, percent a positive or null floating number, p0 and p are positive integers (&gt; 0)</p><pre><code>Examples:nb_year(1500, 5, 100, 5000) -&gt; 15nb_year(1500000, 2.5, 10000, 2000000) -&gt; 10</code></pre><h4 id="note">Note:</h4><ul><li><p>Don't forget to convert the percent parameter as a percentage in the body of your function: if the parameter percent is 2 you have to convert it to 0.02.</p></li><li><p>There are no fractions of people.
