Miriam, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibits. She gives them a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating.</p><p>However, just as she finished rating all exhibits, she's off to an important fair, so she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the exhibits after removing the lowest one. Fair enough.</p><h1 id="task">Task</h1><p>Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. <strong><span style="color:red">Do not mutate the original array/list.</span></strong> If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with the lowest index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.</p><p>Don't change the order of the elements that are left.</p><h3 id="examples">Examples</h3><pre><code>* Input: [1,2,3,4,5], output = [2,3,4,5]* Input: [5,3,2,1,4], output = [5,3,2,4]* Input: [2,2,1,2,1], output = [2,2,2,1]</code></pre>
