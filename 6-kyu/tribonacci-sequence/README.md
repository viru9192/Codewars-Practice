<h2><a href=https://www.codewars.com/kata/556deca17c58da83c00002db/train/python target="_blank">Tribonacci Sequence</a></h2><h3>6 kyu</h3><p>Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci.</p><p>As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next. And, worse part of it, regrettably I won't get to hear non-native Italian speakers trying to pronounce it :(</p><p>So, if we are to start our Tribonacci sequence with <code>[1, 1, 1]</code> as a starting input (AKA <em>signature</em>), we have this sequence:</p><pre><code>[1, 1 ,1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, ...]</code></pre><p>But what if we started with <code>[0, 0, 1]</code> as a signature? As starting with <code>[0, 1]</code> instead of <code>[1, 1]</code> basically <em>shifts</em> the common Fibonacci sequence by once place, you may be tempted to think that we would get the same sequence shifted by 2 places, but that is not the case and we would get:</p><pre><code>[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, ...]</code></pre><p>Well, you may have guessed it by now, but to be clear: you need to create a fibonacci function that given a <strong>signature</strong> array/list, returns <strong>the first n elements - signature included</strong> of the so seeded sequence.</p><p>Signature will always contain 3 numbers; n will always be a non-negative number; if <code>n == 0</code>, then return an empty array (except in C return NULL) and be ready for anything else which is not clearly specified ;)</p><p>If you enjoyed this kata more advanced and generalized version of it can be found in the <a title="Xbonacci sequence" href="http://www.codewars.com/kata/fibonacci-tribonacci-and-friends" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">Xbonacci kata</a></p><p><em>[Personal thanks to Professor <a title="Jim Fowler" href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/jimfowler" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">Jim Fowler</a> on Coursera for his awesome classes that I really recommend to any math enthusiast and for showing me this mathematical curiosity too with his usual contagious passion :)]</em></p>
